Trend Analysis: We'll analyze the trend of revenue and expenses over the years to identify patterns or fluctuations.

Revenue Composition Analysis: We'll break down the revenue sources (tax revenue, grants, other revenue) and analyze their contributions over the years.

Expense Composition Analysis: We'll break down the expense categories (compensation of employees, interest payments, subsidies, etc.) and analyze their proportions over the years.

Surplus/Deficit Analysis: We'll calculate the surplus or deficit for each fiscal year and analyze the trend. We'll determine if the government is operating with a surplus or deficit and how it's changing over time.

Budget Projection Accuracy: We'll compare the budget projections with actual revenue and expenses to assess the accuracy of the projections.

Ministry Budget Analysis: We'll analyze the budget allocations for each ministry over the years and identify any significant changes or trends.

Let's start with the Trend Analysis. I'll proceed with analyzing the trend of revenue and expenses over the years.

To conduct the trend analysis, we'll first need to organize the provided data into a format that allows us to easily analyze the trends over time. We'll focus on the revenue and expense data for this analysis.

Let's start by extracting the revenue and expense data from the provided information:

Revenue:

Actual Revenue for the years 2022/23 to 2026/27
Tax Revenue (including breakdown)
Grants
Other Revenue
Expense:

Total Expense for the years 2022/23 to 2026/27
Expense breakdown by category
Once we have the data extracted, we can visualize the trend over time using graphs or charts.

Let's proceed with extracting and organizing the data for the Trend Analysis.

To continue with the analysis, we'll extract the relevant revenue and expense data from the provided information and organize it into a format suitable for analysis. Then, we'll visualize the trend over the years.

Let's start with extracting the revenue data:

Revenue:

Actual Revenue for the years 2022/23 to 2026/27
Tax Revenue (including breakdown)
Grants
Other Revenue
Once we have the revenue data organized, we'll move on to extracting and organizing the expense data.

Let's begin by extracting the revenue data.

First, we'll organize the revenue data:

Revenue:

Actual revenue for the years 2022/23 to 2026/27
Tax revenue (including breakdown)
Grants
Other revenue
We'll create a table or dataframe to store this data, making it easier to analyze and visualize the trend over the years.

Let's start by organizing the revenue data.

Here's the organized revenue data:

Year	Actual Revenue	Tax Revenue	Taxes on Income, Profits, and Capital Gains	Taxes on Goods and Services	Grants	Other Revenue
2022/23	17,193.3	8,433.6	4,305.9	4,127.7	1,155.1	2,205.1
2023/24	23,806.6	9,741.2	4,734.7	5,006.4	1,464.8	2,452.1
2024/25	27,712.6	9,948.3	4,930.9	5,017.0	3,659.9	2,556.3
2025/26	27,907.4	10,944.5	5,217.7	5,726.3	3,179.5	2,691.6
2026/27	28,343.2	11,375.5	5,398.7	5,976.1	2,895.0	2,801.1
Next, let's extract and organize the expense data.

Now, let's organize the expense data:

Expense:

Total expense for the years 2022/23 to 2026/27
Expense breakdown by category
We'll create another table or dataframe to store this data, similar to how we organized the revenue data.

Let's start by organizing the expense data.

Here's the organized expense data:

Year	Total Expense	Compensation of Employees	Interest Payments	Subsidies	Grants to Other General Government Units	Social Benefits	Other Expense	Capital Budget
2022/23	15,599.9	6,921.2	709.5	554.6	1,657.2	1,874.6	1,254.9	3,206.5
2023/24	17,158.6	7,158.8	1,006.5	787.7	2,251.9	2,207.0	1,290.8	4,480.7
2024/25	19,061.7	7,866.9	1,006.8	676.2	1,818.2	2,344.2	1,942.6	9,695.2
2025/26	19,460.9	8,033.2	1,104.3	710.9	1,969.9	2,348.8	1,722.8	8,791.8
2026/27	20,157.0	8,225.6	1,211.6	722.9	2,130.4	2,394.0	1,731.3	8,842.1
Now that we have both revenue and expense data organized, we can proceed with analyzing the trends over the years. Let's visualize the trends for both revenue and expenses.

To analyze the trends in revenue and expenses over the years, we'll create visualizations such as line graphs to illustrate the changes over time.

Let's start by visualizing the trend in revenue:

Line graph showing the trend of actual revenue over the years.
Stacked bar graph showing the composition of revenue components (tax revenue, grants, other revenue) for each year.
Then, we'll visualize the trend in expenses:

Line graph showing the trend of total expenses over the years.
Stacked bar graph showing the composition of expense categories (compensation of employees, interest payments, subsidies, etc.) for each year.

To calculate the growth rate, we'll use the following formula:

Growth Rate
=
(
Current Year Value
−
Previous Year Value
Previous Year Value
)
×
100
Growth Rate=( 
Previous Year Value
Current Year Value−Previous Year Value
​
 )×100
We'll calculate the growth rates for both revenue and expenses for each year.

Revenue Growth Rate:

Revenue Growth Rate=(

Expense Growth Rate:

Let's calculate these growth rates.

Here are the calculated growth rates for revenue and expenses:

Revenue Growth Rates:

2023/24: 10.4%
2024/25: 10.4%
Expense Growth Rates:

2023/24: 8.6%
2024/25: 11.1%
These growth rates provide insights into how revenue and expenses have been changing over the years.
